<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there!! I am Jhay. <br/>
  I recently started my journey into the tech world. I have always been facsinated by the stunning ideas and implementations of different range of technologies, websites, and many more.
  So then i decided to learn this art. Be a master of it too. Make people amazed, help people and many other things. I mean, why be a king, when you can be a god. <br/>Soon, I will show off my 'creations'. The world is truly your Oyster.
