    <p>
        Everyone Hates Chris is while growing up at Bedford-Stuyvesant, 
        Brooklyn, New York City, an American television storyline 
        sit-com that depicts the troubled experiences of 
        comedian Chris Rock. <br/> 
        The show's title parodies the hit CBS sitcom 
        Everybody Loves Raymond, in which Rock stated:
        "Everybody Loves Raymond, however Everyone 
        Hates Chris!" .
